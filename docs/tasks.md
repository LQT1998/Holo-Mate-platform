# Tasks: Holo-Mate AI Companion Platform

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-x-y-d/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory ✓
   → Implementation plan loaded successfully
   → Extracted: Python + FastAPI, Unity 2022+, Next.js, PostgreSQL + Redis
2. Load optional design documents: ✓
   → data-model.md: 10 entities extracted → model tasks
   → contracts/: 50+ endpoints → contract test tasks
   → research.md: 12 technical decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category: ✓
   → Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: models, services, CLI commands
   → Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules: ✓
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...) ✓
6. Generate dependency graph ✓
7. Create parallel execution examples ✓
8. Validate task completeness: ✓
   → All contracts have tests
   → All entities have models
   → All endpoints implemented
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution) ✓
```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts
- Follow TDD: Red → Green → Refactor cycle
- Use real dependencies in integration tests
- Maintain constitutional principles throughout

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- All implemented endpoints use DEV mode with mock data
- Streaming service endpoints consolidated in `streaming.py` (removed `sessions.py`)
- API paths standardized per tasks.md requirements
- Device, Subscription, and Voice Profile endpoints not yet implemented

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**: 50+ endpoints → contract test tasks [P]
2. **From Data Model**: 10 entities → model creation tasks [P]
3. **From User Stories**: 9 scenarios → integration test tasks [P]
4. **Ordering**: Setup → Tests → Models → Services → Endpoints → Polish → Release
5. **Dependencies**: Tests block implementation, models block services

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests
- [x] All entities have model tasks
- [x] All tests come before implementation
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Added missing tasks: test DB fixtures, full-duplex streaming, GDPR data erasure
- [x] Added Unity asset pipeline and AI emotion mapping
- [x] Added monitoring, tracing, and release pipeline tasks
