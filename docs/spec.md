## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to interact with a personalized AI companion that appears as a 3D hologram, providing natural conversation through voice and displaying realistic emotions and gestures. The user can customize their companion's appearance and personality, and the companion remembers their conversations and preferences over time.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has the mobile app installed and a hologram device connected, **When** they speak to their AI companion, **Then** the companion responds with voice and synchronized 3D animations displayed on the hologram device
2. **Given** a user wants to personalize their companion, **When** they access the customization menu, **Then** they can modify appearance, voice, and personality traits with real-time preview
3. **Given** a user has been chatting with their companion for several sessions, **When** they reference previous conversations, **Then** the companion demonstrates memory of past interactions and context
4. **Given** multiple users want to interact with the same companion, **When** they take turns speaking, **Then** the system handles multi-user conversations appropriately
5. **Given** a user's hologram device loses connection, **When** the connection is restored, **Then** the conversation continues seamlessly from where it left off

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the hologram device is offline but the user wants to chat via mobile app only?
- How does the system handle overlapping voice commands from multiple users?
- What occurs when AI service is temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system behave when voice recognition fails to understand the user?
- What happens if the 3D rendering performance degrades on the hologram device?
