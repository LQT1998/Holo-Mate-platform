## Summary
Holo-Mate is a next-generation AI Companion platform combining real-time voice chat with 3D hologram display. The system includes mobile/web apps for user management, backend microservices for AI processing (LLM + STT/TTS), Unity client for 3D rendering, and hologram device integration. Technical approach uses Python FastAPI microservices, Unity 2022+ for 3D rendering, PostgreSQL + Redis for data, and AWS for deployment.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+, Unity 2022.3+, Node.js 18+, TypeScript 5+
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, Unity URP, Next.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, OpenAI API, ElevenLabs, Whisper
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (cache/session), S3 (assets)
**Testing**: pytest, Unity Test Framework, Jest, Playwright
**Target Platform**: AWS (ECS/EKS), iOS/Android, Web browsers, Hologram devices
**Project Type**: Multi-platform (web + mobile + unity + backend)
**Performance Goals**: 1.2s voice response latency, 5k concurrent sessions, 99.9% uptime
**Constraints**: <2s 95th percentile latency, GDPR compliance, real-time streaming
**Scale/Scope**: 5k concurrent voice sessions, 100k+ users, multi-device sync

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 6 (auth_service, ai_service, streaming_service, web_app, mobile_app, unity_client)
- Using framework directly? Yes (FastAPI, Unity URP, Next.js)
- Single data model? No (separate models for different domains)
- Avoiding patterns? Repository pattern used for data access layer

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes - each service is a library
- Libraries listed: 
  - auth_lib (authentication, JWT, OAuth)
  - ai_lib (LLM integration, context management)
  - streaming_lib (STT/TTS streaming, WebSocket handling)
  - hologram_lib (3D rendering, device communication)
  - shared_lib (common models, utilities)
- CLI per library: Each service exposes CLI for testing/debugging
- Library docs: llms.txt format planned for each library

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes (PostgreSQL, Redis, actual AI APIs in integration tests)
- Integration tests for: All service contracts, shared schemas, streaming protocols
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase

**Observability**:

- Frontend logs → backend? Yes (unified logging stream)
- Error context sufficient? Yes (request tracing, user context, error details)

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes (1.0.0 for MVP)
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? Yes (API versioning, migration plans)

**Structure Decision**: Multi-platform structure due to web + mobile + unity + backend requirements

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - AI/ML integration patterns for real-time streaming
   - Unity 3D rendering optimization for hologram devices
   - WebSocket/WebRTC streaming protocols
   - Device integration patterns for hologram hardware
   - Voice processing pipeline optimization

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research real-time AI streaming patterns for voice chat applications"
   Task: "Research Unity 3D rendering optimization for hologram display devices"
   Task: "Research WebSocket vs WebRTC for low-latency audio streaming"
   Task: "Research device integration patterns for hologram hardware"
   Task: "Research voice processing pipeline optimization (STT + LLM + TTS)"
   Task: "Research GDPR compliance patterns for AI conversation data"
   Task: "Research microservices architecture for AI applications"
   Task: "Research cost optimization strategies for LLM/TTS APIs"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User, AICompanion, Conversation, HologramDevice, CharacterAsset, Subscription, UserPreference, VoiceProfile, AnimationSequence
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions for conversation flow, device pairing

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication endpoints (OAuth, JWT refresh)
   - AI companion management (CRUD, customization)
   - Conversation endpoints (start, continue, history)
   - Streaming endpoints (WebSocket for real-time chat)
   - Device management (pairing, status, control)
   - Subscription management (billing, tier changes)
   - Output OpenAPI schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Voice conversation flow (STT → LLM → TTS → 3D animation)
   - Character customization workflow
   - Multi-device synchronization
   - Subscription tier enforcement
   - Device pairing and setup

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Run `/scripts/update-agent-context.sh claude` for Claude Code
   - Add Holo-Mate specific context and technical decisions
   - Update with recent AI/ML and Unity development patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Service order: auth_service → ai_service → streaming_service → frontend → unity_client
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 40-50 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Backend microservices (auth, ai, streaming)
- Frontend applications (web, mobile)
- Unity client development
- Infrastructure setup
- Testing and validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| 6 projects (vs 3 max) | Multi-platform requirements (web + mobile + unity + backend) | Single platform insufficient for hologram + mobile + web access |
| Repository pattern | Data access abstraction needed for multiple data sources | Direct DB access insufficient for complex queries and caching |
| Multiple data models | Different domains (auth, ai, streaming, hologram) have different needs | Single model would be overly complex and violate separation of concerns |
| Complex streaming architecture | Real-time voice processing requires specialized services | Simple request/response insufficient for streaming audio |
